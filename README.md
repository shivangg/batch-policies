# Policies and Rules

## The social rules are: (Courtesy of Recurse Center)
- No well-actually’s
- No feigned surprise
- No backseat driving
- No subtle -isms

**Pesto is dedicated to providing a harassment-free learning environment and community for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, or anything else. We do not tolerate harassment in any form.**

#### No well-actually’s

Alice: I just installed Linux on my computer!
Bob: It’s actually called GNU/Linux.

**Defn**: A well-actually is when you correct someone about something that’s not relevant to the conversation or tangential to what they’re trying to say.

**The best rule of thumb is, if you’re not sure whether something needs to be said right now, hold off and see what happens.**

#### No feigned surprise

Dan: What’s the command line?
Carol: Wait, you’ve never used the command line?

**Defn**: Feigned surprise is when you act surprised when someone doesn’t know something.

**A good rule of thumb is that always know that you cannot know the entirety of a subject. Also, there are people from other educational backgrounds studying Programming. Hence, they may not know all the jargon.**

#### No backseat driving

Bob: What’s the name of the string copy function?
Alice: `strncpy`.
Eve: (from across the room) You should use `strlcpy`. It’s safer.

**Defn**: Backseat driving is when you lob advice from across the room without joining a conversation. Because you haven’t been participating in the conversation, it’s easy to miss something important and give advice that’s not actually helpful.

Even if your advice is correct, it’s rude to bust into a conversation without asking.

**If you overhear a conversation where you could be helpful, the best thing to do is to ask to join.**

#### No subtle -isms

Carol: Windows is hard to use.
Bob: No way. Windows is so easy to use that even my mom can use it.

**Defn**: Subtle -isms are subtle expressions of racism, sexism, ageism, homophobia, transphobia and other kinds of bias and prejudice.

**If you see racism, sexism, etc. outside of Pesto, please don’t bring it in. For example, please don’t start a discussion about the latest offensive comment from Random Tech Person Y.**


## Additional Rules

- **3 days of permitted leave only.**
- You should collaborate and discuss ideas with your peers. However, make sure that you don't waste their time by asking multiple questions.
